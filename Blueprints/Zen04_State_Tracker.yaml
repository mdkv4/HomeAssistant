blueprint:
  name: Charger Station State Tracker
  description: |
    Track the state of a battery charger station (Idle, Charging, Complete) based on power consumption.
    
    This blueprint monitors a power sensor and automatically transitions through states:
    - Idle: No charging activity (power below threshold)
    - Charging: Active charging detected (power above threshold)
    - Complete: Charging finished (power dropped below threshold after charging)
    
    Requires an input_select helper to be created first with options: Idle, Charging, Complete
